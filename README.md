A simple Terminal app wich can be used for the purpose of reservation on train(can also be extended as any reservation system)

This is implemented in C++ with OOP comcepts

What does it DO?
       Here, mainly it is used for train reservation(I've consided only few coaches but can be extended)
           *Booking Tickets
           *Check the avilablity of seats
           *Cancellation of booked ticket
           
How it works?
      
      Booking:
      *After booking the ticket giving required credentials (i.e) Name,Valid seat no. you will be prompted
       with a unique PNR No. which u should use for further referance
      
      Cancelling:
      *Total PNR ID calcellation
      *Individual seats cancellation
      Two types of cancellation can be done with correct coresponding PNR No.
